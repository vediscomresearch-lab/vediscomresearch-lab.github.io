                        VeDISCom Research is a multidisciplinary
                        research group

                        and
                        data-driven computing and communication systems.
                        Our
                        research spans distributed computing,

                            Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
                            Learning (ML)
                            enable systems to
                            learn from data and make intelligent decisions.
                            Our
                            research applies AI and
                            ML techniques to vehicular networks, distributed
                            systems, and edge computing

                            This research focuses on improving the
                            efficiency,
                            accuracy, and scalability
                            of machine learning and data analysis
                            algorithms.
                            Emphasis is placed on
                            optimization techniques for training, inference,
                            and
